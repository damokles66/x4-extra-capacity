# x4-extra-capacity
Modding scripts for X4

extract.py extracts the games(and extensions) cat files for editing
createMod parses the extracted files and creates the xml patches, packs them all together and uploads the mod.

Obviously this does not contain any error handling, checks and so on.
But in general it should work as long as you have XRCatTool installed and adjust the paths according to your installation.
